                HMRC introduced IR35, or "Intermediaries Legislation," in 2000
                as tax legislation specifically designed to combat tax avoidance
                by workers supplying services to clients through an
                intermediary, such as a limited company, and used to assess
                whether a contractor is a genuine contractor rather than a
                "disguised" employee for the purposes of paying tax. Genuine
                contractors, freelancers, or consultants have nothing to fear
                from IR35 regulations and are free to take use of the benefits
                of using an intermediary firm. Employees who work 'outside IR35'
                can get money in the form of dividends from their limited
                enterprises.

                2022. 0T - Because you did not send a P45 or complete a P46
                prior to your first payment, you do not have any tax allowances.
                It could also signify that HMRC has depleted or reduced your
                allowances to zero. BR - You have a second job/pension. Your
                entire income will be taxed at 20%. If you do not have a second
                employment or a pension, you should contact HMRC to make the
                necessary changes. D0 - You hold a second job/pension and pay a
                higher tax rate. Your entire income will be taxed at 40%. If you
                do not have a second employment or a pension, you should contact
                HMRC to make the necessary changes. D1 - You have a second

                taxed at 45%. If you do not have a second employment or a

                month separately and pay you an equal amount of tax-free wages
