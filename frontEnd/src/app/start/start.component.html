            <h3>Limited Company</h3>
            <p>
              For many contractors, contracting through a limited company
              represents one of the most tax-efficient methods to be paid.
              Setting up your own limited company may be the most efficient way
              for you to work, whether you're just starting out as a contractor
              or freelancer or have been working for a while under an umbrella
              corporation. A limited firm can be formed in a variety of ways,
              but employing a professional contractor accountant can help you
              avoid some of the administrative problems and paperwork that come
              with running one. Learn about limited companies and why they may
              be the ideal contractor payroll solution for you.

            <h3>PAYE Umbrella</h3>
            <p>
              Using an umbrella corporation is the simplest way to get paid.
              It's simple to sign up for an umbrella company, and once you do,
              you're an employee of the umbrella company. With this payroll
              option, there is no need to establish up your own firm or deal
              with any administrative responsibilities other than submitting
              timesheets. Your umbrella payroll provider will manage all taxes,
              including income tax and national insurance. When you select this
              option, you will not be subject to IR35 restrictions. Umbrella
              enterprises, on the other hand, are not the most tax-efficient,
              and if you have the option of contracting through a limited
              company, you may be able to increase your net pay.

          Company incorporation can be accomplished in a few hours, but tax
